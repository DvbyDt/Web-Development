    <h1>Welcome to Simon Game!!</h1>
    <div class="Instructions">
        <h2>The instructions to play the game are:</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Press any key to start the game. Simon will give the first signal. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color lens.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color lenses, in order.            
                </li>
                <li>
                    Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
