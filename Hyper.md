# In this module I studied about the Unix command line.

## The Hyper terminal 

### What I learnt? 
<ul>
  <li> Hyper Terminal is an Electron based terminal. It is built on HTML/CSS/JS.
  <li> Here is the repository link for the same. (https://github.com/vercel/hyper) </li>  
  <li> Think of OS as a pastashio nut. The nut is actually the Kernel and the shell is off course the Shell!! </li>
  <li> Kernel is the heart of the Operating System. Anything that requires some operation and use of the OS requires the OS. </li>
  <li> Shell is an UI that allows users to communicate with the Kernel. </li>
  <li> There are two types of shells : 
  1. GUI or the graphical user interface shell that we use when we are using our OS to create new folders going into My computer etc.
  2. CLI or the command line interface. This is alternating way of communicating with the Kernel.   
  <li>I learnt about the BASH Shell or the Bourne again Shell. The name Bourne because it was developed by a certain Stephen Bourne.(Bourne Shell).</li>
  <li> Why use command line? Because, it's faster and provides with much needed control e.g: Just for creating a directory I have to navigate to that place and right click and create the directory. Bu tin CLI it's mkdir folder_name.
  Another thing is command line will show you all the files present in the foler be it config files or normal files. But in GUI it won't show you hidden files unless you change the default settings in the View.</li>
  
  #### The commands that I learnt: 
  
  <li> ls : It will list the files present in the directory. </li>
  <li> ls-a : It lists all the files even the hidden ones in the directory. </li>
  <li> cd : Change from one directory to another. </li>
  <li> ctrl + u : It will clear everything in the hyper terminal. It's like a select all + backspace kind of operation. </li>
  <li> mkdir: To create a new direcotry. </li>
  <li> touch: Creates a file e.g: touch Text.txt 
  <li> open: to open the file. e.g: open Text.txt
  <li> If you want to specify which program should open the file then you can always use open -a program_name file_name. e.g: open -a atom text.txt
  <li> rm: Remove files.
  <li> rmdir: Remove a directory.
  <li> pwd: Print working directory. 
  <li> If you want to learn more about command line. Here you can find more details : https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial
  <li> **NOTE:** If you have to write space in the CLI always use inverted commans e.g: 'FIFA 21'  </li>
  
</ul>
